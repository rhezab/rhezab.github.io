title: "Short-termism in high school"
excerpt: ""

My biggest regret about high school is that I spent too much time doing old things and too little time learning new things. I made this mistake largely because I suffered from short-termism. 

Short-termism is a tendency to under-estimate the long-term rewards of an investment and/or over-estimate the short-term costs of an investment.

Short-termism impairs your ability to make correct investment decisions. In particular, short-termists find it very difficult to make what I call "delayed gratification" investments. "Delayed gratification" investments are profitable investments that often trick investors by incurring most of the cost up front before rewarding investors much later. [[1]](#Notes) [[2]](#Notes)

Exploring is choosing to try something new; exploiting is sticking with what you know. Correctly choosing to explore when you can exploit is a "delayed gratification" investment (you trade short-term risk for information that improves your future decisions). [[3]](#Notes) Learning a skill is a "delayed gratification" investment (think of the learning curve). Learning a skill in a new domain is doubly a "delayed gratification" investment. That's why as a short-termist, I was so reluctant to learn new things in high school. But why was I a short-termist?

One reason is that I had internalized propaganda about the outsized importance of attending a "prestigous" college. [[4]](#Notes) The truth is that going to a Top-10 college instead of a Top-50 college wouldn't do me any good. [[5]](#Notes) I had over-estimated the importance of doing (exceptionally) well in high school and getting into a "prestigous" college. I had under-estimated how relatively rewarding learning new things is the long run.

A second reason is that high school can be an oddly isolating place. It can feel like you're in a vaccuum separated from the real world. You spend most of your time in high school with students and teachers who spend most of *their* time in high school. It's easy for the lazier amongst us, like me, to forget that there's a big, interesting world outside of high school. 

Most problems aren't unique to anyone, so I assume that other high schoolers also suffer from short-termism (although I hope I'm wrong). [[6]](#Notes) The good news is that short-termism in high school should be easy to fix. The following applies to students, teachers, parents, everyone. Stop exaggerating the importance of getting into an "elite" college. Start encouraging students to spend more time in the real world. Cure students of short-termism and just maybe more students will become explorers.

### <a name="Notes"></a> Notes

[1] An investment is profitable if the area under the reward over time curve is larger than the area under the cost over time curve. 

[2] I realise that it might be more elegant to represant investments as just one utility curve (= Reward - Cost) but I think that it's nice to visualize reward and cost seperately in this case.

[3] The rationally correct answer in a explore vs. exploit decision depends on how many more times you'll make the decision. Hence, your ability to make good explore vs. exploit decisions depends on how far into the future you look (you can't look too close or too far). Consider the following simple explore vs. exploit scenario. You're figuring out where to go for lunch in Louiseville, where there are only two restaurants. You can exploit and eat at your usual spot, Jimmy's Pizzeria, which gives you +3 satisfaction every time you eat there. Or you can explore and try Bob's Burgers. There's a 1/5 chance Bob's Burgers gives you +5 satisfaction every time and a 4/5 chance Bob's Burgers gives you 0 satisfaction every time. Where do you eat if this is your last meal in Louiseville? Where do you eat if you have 2 more meals (including this one) in Louiseville? What if you have *n* more meals? (Hint: How many meals until you correctly decide to explore?)

[4] Paul Graham said in his essay [How to Do What You Love](http://paulgraham.com/love.html) that "conventional attitudes about work are, without the owners even knowng it, nth-degree imitations of the attitudes of people who've done great things." I think that conventional attitudes about how to be successful are in general nth-degree imitations of what successful people *used* to do. Somewhat paradoxically, perhaps the best way to be successful is to cleanse yourself of the desire to be successful for the sake of being successful. 

[5] [What Is an Elite College Really Worth?](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/what-is-an-elite-college-really-worth/521577/ "The Atlantic") Going to an "elite" college helps if you're underpriveledged. My hypothesis is that going to an "elite" college helps underpriveledged people primarily as a signalling and networking tool. 

[6] Most people suffer from some case of short-termism. If they didn't, procrastination wouldn't be a near-universal problem. Short-termism due to the desire to get into a "prestigous college" is a case of short-termism that is probably specific to more priveledged people. You're probably quite lucky to be able to worry about this problem and not much worse ones. But hey, if you're lucky enough to have this problem then you might as well fix it. 

[7] Kind of unrelated, but interesting. The utility (= Reward - Cost) curves for investments in experiences are pretty unintuitive. There are actually two curves, according to Daniel Kahneman. There's the curve for our expriencing selves, which is how much you enjoy this moment *now*. Then there's the curve for our remembering selves, which is how much you'll enjoy this moment *later*. Read Kahneman's [article](https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/Living_DK_JR_2005.pdf) for more. I highly recommend his book [*Thinking Fast & Slow*](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555).
