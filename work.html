<p class="subtitle">February 18, 2021</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote><p>and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn't pick the rider as carefully as the horse... it seems they were all cheated of some marvellous experience which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I'm telling you about it</p><footer>Frank O'Hara, <cite>Having a Coke with You</cite></footer></blockquote></div>

<p><label for="mn-intro" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-intro" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Most of my essays are written mostly for myself; this is especially true for this essay. Don’t take this essay as prescriptive advice. This is what makes sense for me; it might not make sense for you. Future self, this warning applies to you too. </span></p>

<p><span class="newthought">It used to confuse me</span>  when people talked about work-life balance. They talk about all the things they do outside of work: they run, they care for their children, they write. Isn’t that work too? Then I realised that what they meant is balancing their job and their other work. It’s making time to do all the <em>other</em> stuff they should do. Your job is merely a subset of your work.</p>

<p>I’m an incredibly lazy person; I don’t like to struggle if I don’t have to. What I didn’t realise is that struggle is necessary. Life sucks if you don’t strive to make it good.<label for="sn-unfair" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-unfair" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Some of us have to strive much more vigorously than others. Life is unfair. </span> That’s how I realised that life is work. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9VBpbnXhWk&amp;ab_channel=CaseyNeistat">Life is like going the wrong way on a moving sidewalk</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Walk and you stay put.</p>

  <p>Stand still and you go backwards.</p>

  <p>To get ahead, you have to hustle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s difficult for me to accept that life is work. I don’t envy Sisyphus, that’s for sure. Still, I try to accept that life is work because it’s liberating. I spend less time pining after greener pastures; I spend more time tending to my garden. I’m crouched in the sun, back aching, smelling the flowers.</p>

<p>Life is work, but you shouldn’t work on everything. I don’t work for the sake of it.<label for="sn-porn" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-porn" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">For this reason, I’m not a fan of hustle porn. </span> I work because I want life to be better, for myself and for others. So how do you decide what to work on?</p>

<p>Work on what you love. Of course, working on what you love often means doing things you don’t enjoy in the moment. When you suffer, remember why you’re suffering – remember what you love.</p>

<p>Think about who you love, and what they love. Work on that too. There are few things more beautiful than learning to love something loved by someone you love. Even more so when you get to love it together.<label for="sn-love" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-love" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Conversely, there are few things more painful than being ignored after working on something for someone you love. </span></p>

<p>Something I grapple with is the tradeoff between private work and public work. Public work aspires to be broadly and deeply impactful. On the other hand, private work aspires to be <em>narrowly</em> and deeply impactful. Private work is contributing to those closest to you. It’s being a good friend, partner, father. There often seems to be a tradeoff between being a good father (or friend, partner, etc.) and being a <em>really</em> good animator (or engineer, or journalist, etc.) In Gwern’s <a href="https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society"><em>The Melancholy of Subculture Society</em></a>, he quotes “<a href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/www.nausicaa.net/cebe510b9e3806968e70d3a2e4b93a00fb16f328.html">some interesting remarks</a>” by Goro Miyazaki which haunt me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hayao Miyazaki, to me, is “Zero Marks as a Father, Full Marks as a Director”. My father was almost never at home. That’s why for me, when I was a child, my mother had to fill the place of my father. My father came home every day in the middle of the night, after I had already gone to sleep. He was always very conscientious in this regard—apparently, no matter how late it was, he always made sure that he came home. But almost every Saturday and Sunday he was still at work regardless. That’s why, from my earliest awareness to the present day, I hardly ever had the chance to talk to him. He always came back after I was asleep, and when I left for school at 8 o’clock he was still asleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear, I don’t think that contributing to society excuses you from contributing to those closest to you. No matter how brilliant of an animator you are, you don’t get a free pass for being a bad father. But why is there a tradeoff in the first place?</p>

<p>The steepness of this tradeoff is a function of the overlap between public and private work, which is itself a function of the overlap between public and private spheres. In a tribal society, the two spheres sit almost on top of each other. Your tribe is your society.<label for="sn-choe" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-choe" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">There’s this fascinating clip from the Joe Rogan podcast where David Choe talks about <a href="https://youtu.be/FRrbjiOs4no">living with the Hadza people of Tanzania</a>. He goes hunting with them and can’t keep up. His translator tells them that David gets his food from supermarkets. <em>What’s that? They hunt the food for him?</em> They don’t believe it. Later, David tells a Hadza person that they look like a supermodel. He asks them if they want to go to America and do the fashion thing and get paid. They respond incredulously: <em>why would we go to America? Isn’t that where people jump off buildings to kill themselves?</em>  </span> In large scale society, however, the public sphere has eaten much of the private sphere.<label for="sn-arendt" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-arendt" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arendt/">Arendt</a> talks a lot about this. </span> My verdict on this is: good, bad, a little sad.<label for="sn-gwern" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-gwern" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The abstract of Gwern’s <a href="https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society"><em>The Melancholy of Subculture Society</em></a> reads: <em>Internet links small groups, helping dissolve big groups; good, bad? But a bit sad.</em> I see subcultures as an evolution of the private sphere, in response to selection pressure from the public sphere eating it. </span> The sad part is that when things move into the public sphere, they lose their intimacy. Watching Netflix together is somehow not as intimate as telling (or even reading) a bedtime story.</p>

<p>I don’t fully understand this phenomenon.<label for="sn-phenomenon" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-phenomenon" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Understanding this phenomenon is worth a lifetime of essays. I think that much of today’s political debate is actually about this. Pardon the incoming gross overgeneralisation. Liberals want the government to take better care of them (e.g. public healthcare, free college, etc.) but leave them alone otherwise. Libertarians just want to be left alone. Conservatives largely want things the way they were before hyper-globalisation. That’s when the public sphere was <em>just</em> big enough. Now it’s too big. </span> But I think I understand enough to fight the tradeoff between public and private work.<label for="sn-tradeoff" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-tradeoff" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I wanted to say <em>avoid</em> the tradeoff, but that seems disingenuous. Unless the spheres are perfectly overlapping, which will never happen, there will always be some tradeoff – there’s only so much time in a day. </span> There are two ways you can fight this. First, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">relentlessly prune bullshit</a> so that you have more time to do both kinds of work. Second, try to do public work with people you love.<label for="sn-public-tribe" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-public-tribe" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I’m lucky enough to get to do this. I do research with my friend Chris, who I’ve been friends with for a decade. How is cool that? </span> Find your tribe and do public work with them.</p>

<p>That’s all I have to say for now. Work on what you love, for who you love, with who you love. The rest will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKOtQPUNogA&amp;ab_channel=Deezer">follow</a>.</p>

<p><label for="mn-outro" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-outro" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">I notice the sidenotes getting denser and heavier towards the end. I think that sidenotes 4-8 are the beginnings of another essay. Until then… </span></p>
