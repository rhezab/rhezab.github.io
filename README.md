Rheza Budiono's blog. 

* Got started with Jekyll using [this tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css).
* Figured out how to build a local Jekyll site with [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-4-build-your-local-jekyll-site).
* Used [Karpathy's blog](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-4-build-your-local-jekyll-site) as a template - I hope you don't mind
