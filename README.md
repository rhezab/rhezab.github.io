[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is cool because it lets web noobs like me have fast, neat-looking blogs with as little effort as possible. It's so much easier and faster than what I remember of WordPress. If you want to have a neat-looking blog of your own, here's how I did it:

* Got started with Jekyll using [this tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css).
* Figured out how to build a local Jekyll site (so I could see changes locally before committing them) with [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-4-build-your-local-jekyll-site).
* Used [Karpathy's blog](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-4-build-your-local-jekyll-site) as a template - I hope you don't mind.
* Used [Paul Graham's website](http://paulgraham.com/index.html) as design inspiration. I took his font and [text width](http://paulgraham.com/gfaq.html). Also liked his geometric art favicon -- mine is Albers' *Homage to the Square: Ascending*.

### Weird notes:
- use bundle exec jekyll build & bundle exec jekyll serve
- Do relative links work? See [[about]](./about)
